On the 1st of February                  , the Prisoner at the Bar came to my Shop and stole some Candles. my Wife miss'd some, she thought, about 7 lb. the Night before. Some Time after, this Woman came for a halfpenny Candle. My Wife miss'd some Candles that were hung upon the Pegs; upon which she found 6 lb. under her Apron. We ask'd her hour she came by them. She declar'd she bought them in St. John-Street.</p>               <p>Q. Can you swear with any Certainty that these are your Goods?</p>               <p>George. I am certain they were, they were fresh made Candles. The Prisoner's Husband was question'd about the Candles, and said, when we went to his House, if there were any Candles they were ours; where we found 4 lb. more Candles , which I knew to be ours .</p>               <p>                                                                  Q.

My Lord, On Saturday Night I had nobody in the House but myself and little Girl. a Customer in the Neighbourhood sent for some Candles, and said they must have them then. When I came home I miss'd several Pounds of Candles . I found the Prisoner in the Shop for a halfpenny Candle. I turn'd aside her Cloak, and found 6 lb. in her Apron.</p>               <p>Negro, Constable. I took charge of her Saturday Night : When I came, the Candles were taken out of her Lap; which Mrs. George declar'd were her's .</p>               <p>Q.
