Mr. Jordan swore, he sent his Boy of an Errand, who was met by the Prisoner: and complaining to her, that he had been long on his Errand, and fear'd to go home, she told him, his Collar would betray him, and therefore advis'd him to let her take it off; and carrying him to a Fruit-Cellar, the Prisoner and                                  Jane                   Evans                                                                                         broke the Collar with their Teeth, and took it away. After this the Boy came home, and told his Master of it, who took up the Prisoner, and carrying her before a Justice she confess'd, that                                  Jane                   Evans                                                                                         took off the Collar, and that she sold it.
