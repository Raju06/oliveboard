She reply'd, the House stood between the Skettle-Ground and the Yard where the Accident happen'd, and she was of Opinion he could not; but Bell affirm'd, that where he stood, he could see.</p>               <p>                                                John                   Edwards                                                                                         depos'd, That he was playing at Skettles with Bell, that he went out, and saw the Deceas'd up with his Cane, but saw no Sword.</p>               <p>                                                Elizabeth                   Griffith                                                                                         being ask'd, how far she was from the Prisoner and Deceas'd? reply'd, she was about 2 or 3 Yards off, and had there been 5 or 6 Blows struck as Bell had sworn, she must have seen it; but positively depos'd, she saw no blow struck by the Deceas'd. The Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found him                                     guilty             of both Indictments.
