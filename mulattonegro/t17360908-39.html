(A Negro) I was just paid off from the Ship Newcastle, and walking along Rosemary Lane                                                      , between 4 or 5 o'Clock I met 2 Women; I asked them for a Lodging, they bid me come with them: I went with them to Whitcher's House, and we had some Salmon and Punch and a quartern of Brandy? Then I went to bed, and one of the Women came to bed to me, tho' I would not let her: The oldest of the Prisoners pull'd up her Coats, and bid me look at - and told me it was as black as my Face, &amp;c. &amp;c. - I would not do it, but went to sleep, and when I waked I found all my Money gone. One of the Girls own'd before Justice Farmer, that 8 Guineas and 4 s. of my Money was divided among them.</p>               <p>                  Prisoner Smith.

These 2 Creatures own'd before the Justice, that they had divided 8 Guineas and 4s. and that Whitcher had the best part of it. Jones said in New Prison, if we would let her out, she would tell who had most of the Black's Money.</p>               <p>                                                Nathaniel                   Harris                                                                                         and                                  Jeremiah                   Lester                                                                                        , deposed to the same Effect.</p>               <p>The Prisoners in their Defence, said the Black gave them the Money.
