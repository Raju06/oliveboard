The Prisoners and I went to the Prosecutor's Shop: Bently knocked at the Door and went in first and asked for a Pennyworth of Pickle Coucumbers, and as the Prosecutor was going to serve him, Dwyer stept in with a Knife in his Hand and threatned to stick it in the Prosecutor's Body if he did not deliver his Money. Then Bentley went to the Money Box and took out 3 s. 6 d. I stood at the Door all the while to watch, and then we went away to our Lodging at - Bedfords, in Well's Yard by St. Giles's Pound. That House harbours none but such as we are, if the Truth was known. We spent 21 d. there that Night, and shared 7 d. a Piece next Morning.</p>               <p>The Jury found them                                     Guilty            .</p>               <p>They were a second time indicted for                                                          privately stealing 3lb of Nutmegs, value 16 s. the Goods of                                                                         John                            Clements                                                                                                                                      , in his Shop            , Jan. 15                                    .</p>               <p>John Clements.
